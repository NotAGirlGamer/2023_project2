this is a project in witch my team will complete a program with specifications:

One student will design the function main, which will call all other functions in the program.  The remainder of the functions will be divided amongst all members of the team.
The requirements of the program should be analyzed as a team and split up so each student is given about the same workload.
It is important the parameters of each function and its return values be decided ahead of time.
The program should be implemented and shared using github. (The person writing main should create a public repository and share it with all other members of the team).

Here is the assignment:  Create a contact management system that allows users to store and retrieve contact information using a text file. Your program should have at least 7 functions: main, add contact, search contact, edit contact, delete contact, display all contacts.

Here is a breakdown of the required functions:

A main function to drive the program
A function to display the menu and return the choice
An add contact function that will add a contact to the file
A search contact function that will search the file for a contact and return the information for that contact, if found
An edit contact function that will use the search contact function to find someone and change the information if found
A delete contact function that will use the search contact function to find someone and delete the information, if found
A display contacts function that displays all contacts and their information in a readable format

The menu options for the program should be:

1. Add Contact
2. Search Contact
3. Edit Contact
4. Delete Contact
5. Display All Contacts
6. Exit

Implement exception handling for cases where a contact doesn't exist when searching, editing, or deleting.

Each record should have the following fields:
Name:
Street Address:
Phone Number:
Email Address:
